# Changes to This Fork 
This fork aims to provide the extra services to the Steam client such as Steam economy and Microtransactions.

# Steam

This package provides an easy way to get details from the steam api service.  The services it can access are:

- `ISteamNews`
- `IPlayerService`
- `ISteamUser`
- `ISteamUserStats`
- `ISteamApp`

## Installation

Begin by installing this package with composer.

	"require": {
		"syntax/steam-api": "dev-master"
	}

Next, update composer from the terminal.

	composer update syntax/steam-api

> Alternately, you can run "composer require syntax/steam-api:dev-master" from the command line.

Once that is finished, add the service provider to `app/config/app.php`

	'Syntax\SteamApi\SteamApiServiceProvider',

> The alias to Steam is already handled by the package.

Publish the config file.  You can get your API key from [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)

	php artisan config:publish syntax/steam-api

Run the migrations.

	php artisan migrate --package="syntax/steam-api"
